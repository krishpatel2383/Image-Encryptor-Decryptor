# Java-Image-Encryptor-Decryptor
* This project is a Java-based application that provides a simple and basic method for encrypting and decrypting images. The application uses symmetric key cryptography for encryption and decryption.<br/>
* The application will allow users to select an image that they wish to encrypt and decrypt. The image will then be encrypted with a user-selected key.<br/>
* The application also provides the option to decrypt the encrypted image using the same key that was used for encryption.<br/>
* The GUI of the application is not very sophisticated but provides an interface that allows users to perform the desired actions.The GUI includes buttons for loading images, selecting the encryption key, encrypting and decrypting the image.
